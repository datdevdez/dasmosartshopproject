Project Description:

In this project, you’ll build a simple website for a fictional arts and crafts store using the tools on your own computer using HTML & CSS.

The rest of the page’s styling (font sizes, colors, etc.) is outlined in the design spec, which is a standard document you’d expect to receive as a freelance web developer.

Folder contains:

	index.html (webpage html framework)
	images folder (images used in project)
	styles folder (CSS stylesheets)
	design-spec-outline folder (Document outline for what client expects)
